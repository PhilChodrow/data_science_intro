# Advanced Tidyverse and Dashboarding

*Instructors: Ted Papalexopoulos, Andy Zheng*

In the first half of this session session we will deep dive into the more advanced functionalities of the `tidyverse` that can help streamline data manipulation and model iteration. We will learn about two fundamental concepts that every data scientist must navigate, namely how to merge diverse datasets and the difference between wide and long data. Along the way, we will learn several new functions for data manipulation that minimize code repetition, are computationally more efficient, and make downstream tasks in modeling and visualization easier.

In the second half, we will introduce the `shiny` package for dashboarding, useful both in the exploration phase of an analysis and for communicating results to a broader audience. We will learn about reactive data and functions, how to map between inputs and outputs, and how to create a simple interactive dashboard to present results of an analysis.

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. Use scoped versions of `dplyr` verbs to manipulate multiple variables at once, as well as window and ranking functions. 
2. Use the six different types of table joins for merging datasets, and their `fuzzyjoin` equivalents.
3. Understand the difference between long and wide data, when each is appropriate and how to transition between the two. 
4. Use `shiny` to create a simple interactive dashboard for exploring data and communicating insights.
